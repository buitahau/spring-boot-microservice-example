RESTFUL Spring boot
-------------------
- HATEOAS: Provides some APIs to ease creating REST
representations that follow the HATEOAS principle when working with Spring and especially Spring MVC. The core problem it tries to address is link creation and representation assembly.
- Swagger2: Auto builds reference documentation every change in the API
(/v2/api-docs, /swagger-resources).
